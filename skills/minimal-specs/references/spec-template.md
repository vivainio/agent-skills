# Spec Template

Use this minimal template when creating a new spec file in `specs/`.

```markdown
# <feature-name>

## What
One or two sentences describing the feature.

## Why
Motivation or context. What problem does this solve?

## Decisions
Key design decisions made (e.g. approach chosen, alternatives rejected).

## Open questions
Anything unresolved. Remove section if empty.
```

## Notes

- Keep it short. A spec that fits on one screen is better than one that doesn't.
- Update the **Decisions** section as implementation progresses.
- It is fine to leave sections empty or remove them if not applicable.
