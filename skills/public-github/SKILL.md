# Public GitHub Setup

Configure public GitHub repositories with SSH authentication and PyPI trusted publisher.

## Security: User Confirmation Required

**Before performing any mutating operation on a public GitHub repository, you MUST confirm with the user at least once during the chat session.** This prevents accidental data exfiltration.

### No Internal References

Public GitHub projects must not contain references to internal products, projects, or proprietary systems. Before pushing, verify the code does not include:
- Internal project names, codenames, or acronyms
- References to internal tools, services, or infrastructure
- Internal URLs, hostnames, or endpoints
- Proprietary business logic or trade secrets
- Internal documentation links or Confluence/wiki references

Mutating operations include:
- `git push`
- `gh release create`
- `gh issue create`
- `gh pr create`
- `gh repo create`
- Any other operation that writes to the public repository

Ask the user to confirm before proceeding with these operations.

## SSH Config for Multiple Accounts

Use SSH host aliases to distinguish between public (personal) and private (work) GitHub accounts.

### ~/.ssh/config

```
# Private/work GitHub
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work

# Public GitHub
Host github-public
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_public
```

### Usage

For **public** repositories, use `github-public` host alias:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github-public:someuser/myproject.git
```

For **private/work** repositories, use standard `github.com`:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:company/repo.git
```

### Verify

```bash
git remote -v
# origin  git@github-public:someuser/myproject.git (fetch)
# origin  git@github-public:someuser/myproject.git (push)
```

## PyPI Publishing with Trusted Publishers

Use GitHub Actions with OIDC authentication (no API tokens needed).

### 1. Configure PyPI Trusted Publisher

Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/ and add:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| PyPI project name | `your-package-name` |
| Owner | Your GitHub username |
| Repository | Your repo name |
| Workflow name | `publish.yml` |
| Environment | `pypi` |

### 2. Create GitHub Environment

Go to repo Settings → Environments → New environment → name it `pypi`.

### 3. Add Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Publish to PyPI

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: pypi
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set version from release tag
        run: |
          VERSION="${{ github.ref_name }}"
          VERSION="${VERSION#v}"
          sed -i "s/^version = .*/version = \"$VERSION\"/" pyproject.toml
          echo "Set version to $VERSION"

      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

      - name: Build package
        run: uv build

      - name: Publish to PyPI
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

### 4. Create Release

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT manually edit `version` in pyproject.toml.** The workflow sets it from the release tag automatically. Use a placeholder version in pyproject.toml:

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT create tags manually with `git tag`.** The `gh release create` command creates the tag automatically. Creating tags separately is unnecessary and can cause issues.

```toml
version = "0.0.0.dev"  # Set by CI from release - do not edit manually
```

```bash
gh release create v0.1.0 --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's Changed
- Feature X: description from user perspective
- Breaking: Y now requires Z
- Fix: description of bug fix
EOF
)"
```

Generate release notes using AI to summarize changes from a user perspective, highlighting breaking changes. Avoid `--generate-notes` which just lists commits mechanically.

The workflow automatically extracts version from release tag (strips `v` prefix) and publishes.

## gh CLI with Multiple Accounts

If `gh` commands fail with permission errors (e.g., "workflow scope may be required"), you may have the wrong account active.

### Check Active Account

```bash
gh auth status
```

Look for `Active account: true` to see which account is currently active.

### Switch Account

```bash
gh auth switch --user vivainio   # Switch to public account
gh auth switch --user work_user  # Switch to work account
```

### Verify and Retry

```bash
gh auth status                    # Confirm correct account is active
gh release create v0.1.0 ...     # Retry the command
```
